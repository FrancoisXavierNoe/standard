# FileVault Setup

FileVault is full-disk encryption for macOS and required for all Sparkbox laptops. If you setup your laptop with the [new laptop script](https://github.com/sparkbox/laptop) this has already been completed. You can see if FileVault is already enabled by running:

    fdesetup status

If this prints anything other than `FileVault is On.` then you need to complete this process using [Apple's FileVault setup instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837).
