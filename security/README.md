# Security

## Principles
- Sparkbox employees and clients should understand our philosophy on 
information security.
- Sparkbox employees and clients should have confidence that their intellectual
property and assets are reasonably safe when in our care.
- Sparkbox would prefer not to be in the business of maintaining critical
client resources where possible.
- Sparkbox will act openly and dutifully with employees and clients to resolve
security concerns.
- Weâ€™ll use this to make smart decisions about security, data, and digital
asset risk.

## General Policy
No policy can set forth rules to cover every possible situation.  Instead,
Sparkbox Security Policies are designed to express our philosophy and set forth
principles and guidelines for the intelligent use of resources.  All such uses
should demonstrate a sense of responsibility and respect for critical business
assets of Sparkbox and its clients.  When in doubt about any matter related to
security, employees should communicate quickly and clearly in the #security
Slack channel.

The following guides provide instructions for checking the status of and
