# Harvest

We use Harvest to track time for all of our projects. Project managers add team members to the correct projects.

This is used in conjunction with Forecast for long-term planning.

We expect time to be tracked throughout the day or at least entered into Harvest by the end of each day.

## App
Harvest has apps available for macOS, iOS, and Android. We recommend using these for daily time tracking.

## Timesheets
Timesheets need to be submitted through Harvest by Monday at 9am.
