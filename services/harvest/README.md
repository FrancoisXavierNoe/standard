# Harvest

We use Harvest to track time for all of our projects. Your project manager will add you to the correct projects.

This is used in conjunction with Forecast for long term planning.

The expectation is that time is being tracked throughout the day, or at least entered into Harvest by the end of each day.

## App
There are apps available for macOS, iOS and Android. We recommend using these for daily time tracking.

## Timesheets
Timesheets need to be submitted through Harvest by Monday at 9am.
