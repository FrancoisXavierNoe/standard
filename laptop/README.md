# Sparkbox Laptop Maintenance

## Wipe it clean

Use the [Apple provided command line utility][apple-cli] to create a bootable drive. Use that drive to boot up the old Mac by holding down `OPT` during a restart. Once you've booted off the external drive, select Disk Utility and erase the internal Mac drive.

After that re-install the current and latest Mac OS X.

## Laptop Script

Follow the instructions for the [Sparkbox Laptop] script.
